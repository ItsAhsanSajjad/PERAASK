This is to ensure that information provided by candidates is accurate and that individuals have a record befitting public service roles.

Any discrepancy (such as a fake degree or an unverifiable credential) is taken very seriously – it can lead to immediate withdrawal of the job offer or termination if discovered after joining, as it constitutes misconduct (submission of false documents). • Employment History and Reference Check: HR may verify past employment details provided by the candidate (for experienced hires). Typically, the last employer or two are contacted to confirm the duration of employment and the nature of the person’s exit. In many cases, candidates provide reference letters or contact information of supervisors. PERA may reach out via phone or official email to inquire about the candidate’s work ethic, conduct, and reason for leaving. This helps ensure we are not hiring someone with a history of serious misconduct elsewhere. • Character and Criminal Record Verification: A police verification or character certificate may also be required. The candidate may be asked to provide a Police Character Certificate from their local police station to check if the individual has any criminal record.

This includes performance evaluations, any pending disciplinary proceedings, and general conduct. Deputation is usually only accepted for officers who have a clean service record. PERA’s stance is that the integrity of personnel is non-negotiable. While we trust employees, we also verify. This ensures we maintain a workforce that the public and stakeholders can trust, which is critical in an enforcement and regulatory context. 2.4 Probation Period All initial appointments in PERA – whether of regular or contractual employees – are subject to a Probation Period. The probationary period allows the organization to evaluate a new hire’s performance, conduct, and overall fit for the job, and likewise gives the employee time to understand the role and expectations. The policy for probation is as follows: • Duration of Probation: A person appointed to a regular/permanent position typically undergoes a probation of minimum one (1) year from the date of joining, or as decided by Director General. If the employee’s performance is not satisfactory within this period, the probation may be extended once. For contractual employees, the probation period is usually shorter – commonly three (3) months or six (6) months, as specified in the contract agreement. The exact period for contract staff will be stated in their contract letter. • Probation Terms: During probation, the employee’s work performance, conduct, punctuality, and general suitability are observed and assessed by their immediate supervisor and concerned Director. Clear objectives or key performance indicators (KPIs) should be communicated to the probationer early on (as part of onboarding). Regular feedback should be given to help the probationer improve. Being on probation does not mean the employee is not fully subject to all rules – all policies of PERA apply to probationers as well. However, a probationer does not enjoy the same job security as a confirmed (permanent) employee, making it easier to discharge them if needed. • Confirmation Process: Shortly before the end of the probation period, the HR Department will remind the concerned supervisor to submit a Probation Evaluation Report.

This includes performance evaluations, any pending disciplinary proceedings, and general conduct. Deputation is usually only accepted for officers who have a clean service record. PERA’s stance is that the integrity of personnel is non-negotiable. While we trust employees, we also verify. This ensures we maintain a workforce that the public and stakeholders can trust, which is critical in an enforcement and regulatory context. 2.4 Probation Period All initial appointments in PERA – whether of regular or contractual employees – are subject to a Probation Period. The probationary period allows the organization to evaluate a new hire’s performance, conduct, and overall fit for the job, and likewise gives the employee time to understand the role and expectations. The policy for probation is as follows: • Duration of Probation: A person appointed to a regular/permanent position typically undergoes a probation of minimum one (1) year from the date of joining, or as decided by Director General. If the employee’s performance is not satisfactory within this period, the probation may be extended once. For contractual employees, the probation period is usually shorter – commonly three (3) months or six (6) months, as specified in the contract agreement. The exact period for contract staff will be stated in their contract letter. • Probation Terms: During probation, the employee’s work performance, conduct, punctuality, and general suitability are observed and assessed by their immediate supervisor and concerned Director. Clear objectives or key performance indicators (KPIs) should be communicated to the probationer early on (as part of onboarding). Regular feedback should be given to help the probationer improve. Being on probation does not mean the employee is not fully subject to all rules – all policies of PERA apply to probationers as well. However, a probationer does not enjoy the same job security as a confirmed (permanent) employee, making it easier to discharge them if needed. • Confirmation Process: Shortly before the end of the probation period, the HR Department will remind the concerned supervisor to submit a Probation Evaluation Report. This report will outline the employee’s performance, strengths, weaknesses, and a recommendation whether to confirm, extend probation, or terminate the employment. The evaluation"}

For regular employees, this means they attain permanent status; for contract employees, it simply means they have successfully passed the initial trial and continue for the rest of contract term. • Extension of Probation: If the employee’s performance has not been fully up to the mark, but the organization sees potential in the individual, an extension of the probation period may be granted for a specified term by the Director General. The extension decision must be communicated via a written order before the initial probation expires. It should outline the areas where improvement is needed and set targets for the extended period. If at the end of extended period, the performance still fails to meet requirements, the employee’s service may be dispensed with (not confirmed). • Termination During Probation: PERA reserves the right to terminate the employment of a probationary employee without the lengthy procedures required for confirmed staff. Termination during probation can be due to unsatisfactory performance, misconduct, or if the person is found unsuitable for the role. However, this step is taken after giving feedback and chances to improve, except in cases of serious misconduct which may warrant immediate removal. • Rights of Probationers: A probationary employee is not entitled to appeal a termination in the same way a permanent employee might, since by law their appointment was not confirmed.

All employees must mark their attendance daily, both at the time of arrival and departure. If an employee is assigned off-site duties or is on approved travel, they should notify their supervisor and HR so that attendance can be recorded appropriately. • Punctuality: Employees are expected to be present at their workstations and ready to work by the official start time. Habitual lateness is not acceptable. Persistent tardiness or leaving early without authorization will be noted and could lead to deductions in leave or pay, and disciplinary action if it continues despite warnings. • Absence and Leave Approval: Any planned absence from work during scheduled hours must be covered by an appropriate leave approval (see Chapter IV on Leave). If an employee is unexpectedly unable to attend (e.g., sudden illness or emergency), they must notify their supervisor or the HR office within the same working day, preferably at the start of the day by phone or email. Unauthorized absence (not informing or not having leave sanctioned) is treated seriously as it disrupts work and indicates negligence. • Attendance Monitoring: The Admin Wing will monitor attendance records on a periodic basis (weekly or monthly) to identify issues like chronic lateness or absenteeism.

Continued attendance issues after warnings can lead to formal disciplinary action.

This is to ensure that information provided by candidates is accurate and that individuals have a record befitting public service roles. The components of the background check process include:\n\nEducational Verification: The degrees, diplomas, and certificates claimed by the selected candidate are verified for authenticity. For higher education degrees, this may involve verifying the degree through the Higher Education Commission (HEC) or the issuing university. Candidates may be required to provide HEC attested copies of their degrees. Any discrepancy (such as a fake degree or an unverifiable credential) is taken very seriously – it can lead to immediate withdrawal of the job offer or termination if discovered after joining, as it constitutes misconduct (submission of false documents).\n\nEmployment History and Reference Check: HR may verify past employment details provided by the candidate (for experienced hires). Typically, the last employer or two are contacted to confirm the duration of employment and the nature of the person’s exit. In many cases, candidates provide reference letters or contact information of supervisors. PERA may reach out via phone or official email to inquire about the candidate’s work ethic, conduct, and reason for leaving. This helps ensure we are not hiring someone with a history of serious misconduct elsewhere.\n\nCharacter and Criminal Record Verification: A police verification or character certificate may also be required. The candidate may be asked to provide a Police Character Certificate from their local police station to check if the individual has any criminal record. The absence of a criminal history, especially for fraud, theft, or violence, is expected given the trust placed in public officials. For regular employees of the Authority, a more intensive background check might be conducted through official channels.\n\nDeputationists: If an employee joins on deputation from another government department, PERA may obtain their service record from the parent department.

This is to ensure that information provided by candidates is accurate and that individuals have a record befitting public service roles. The components of the background check process include:\n\nEducational Verification: The degrees, diplomas, and certificates claimed by the selected candidate are verified for authenticity. For higher education degrees, this may involve verifying the degree through the Higher Education Commission (HEC) or the issuing university. Candidates may be required to provide HEC attested copies of their degrees. Any discrepancy (such as a fake degree or an unverifiable credential) is taken very seriously – it can lead to immediate withdrawal of the job offer or termination if discovered after joining, as it constitutes misconduct (submission of false documents).\n\nEmployment History and Reference Check: HR may verify past employment details provided by the candidate (for experienced hires). Typically, the last employer or two are contacted to confirm the duration of employment and the nature of the person’s exit. In many cases, candidates provide reference letters or contact information of supervisors. PERA may reach out via phone or official email to inquire about the candidate’s work ethic, conduct, and reason for leaving. This helps ensure we are not hiring someone with a history of serious misconduct elsewhere.\n\nCharacter and Criminal Record Verification: A police verification or character certificate may also be required. The candidate may be asked to provide a Police Character Certificate from their local police station to check if the individual has any criminal record. The absence of a criminal history, especially for fraud, theft, or violence, is expected given the trust placed in public officials. For regular employees of the Authority, a more intensive background check might be conducted through official channels.\n\nDeputationists: If an employee joins on deputation from another government department, PERA may obtain their service record from the parent department. This includes performance evaluations, any pending disciplinary proceedings, and general conduct. Deputation is usually only accepted for officers who have a clean service record.\n\nPERA’s stance is that the integrity of personnel is non-negotiable. While we trust employees, we also verify. This ensures we maintain a workforce that the public and stakeholders can trust, which is critical in an enforcement and regulatory context."}

The probationary period allows the organization to evaluate a new hire’s performance, conduct, and overall fit for the job, and likewise gives the employee time to understand the role and expectations. The policy for probation is as follows:\n\nDuration of Probation: A person appointed to a regular/permanent position typically undergoes a probation of minimum one (1) year from the date of joining, or as decided by Director General. If the employee’s performance is not satisfactory within this period, the probation may be extended once. For contractual employees, the probation period is usually shorter – commonly three (3) months or six (6) months, as specified in the contract agreement. The exact period for contract staff will be stated in their contract letter.\n\nProbation Terms: During probation, the employee’s work performance, conduct, punctuality, and general suitability are observed and assessed by their immediate supervisor and concerned Director. Clear objectives or key performance indicators (KPIs) should be communicated to the probationer early on (as part of onboarding). Regular feedback should be given to help the probationer improve. Being on probation does not mean the employee is not fully subject to all rules – all policies of PERA apply to probationers as well. However, a probationer does not enjoy the same job security as a confirmed (permanent) employee, making it easier to discharge them if needed.\n\nConfirmation Process: Shortly before the end of the probation period, the HR Department will remind the concerned supervisor to submit a Probation Evaluation Report. This report will outline the employee’s performance, strengths, weaknesses, and a recommendation whether to confirm, extend probation, or terminate the employment. The evaluation considers factors such as: quality of work, ability to meet targets, knowledge of tasks, attitude and teamwork, attendance/punctuality, and conduct. If the overall performance is satisfactory and no disciplinary issues have arisen, the concerned Director will recommend confirmation of the employee’s appointment. This recommendation goes to the Competent Authority / Director General for approval. Upon approval, HR issues a Confirmation Letter to the employee, stating an effective date. For regular employees, this means they attain permanent status; for contract employees, it simply means they have successfully passed the initial trial and continue for the rest of contract term.\n\nExtension of Probation: If the employee’s performance has not been fully up to the mark, but the organization sees potential in the individual, an extension of the probation period may be granted for a specified term by the Director General. The extension decision must be communicated via a written order before the initial probation expires. It should outline the areas where improvement is needed and set targets for the extended period. If at the end of extended period, the performance still fails to meet requirements, the employee’s service may be dispensed with (not confirmed).\n\nTermination During Probation: PERA reserves the right to terminate the employment of a probationary employee without the lengthy procedures required for confirmed staff. Termination during probation can be due to unsatisfactory performance, misconduct, or if the person is found unsuitable for the role. However, this step is taken after giving feedback and chances to improve, except in cases of serious misconduct which may warrant immediate removal.\n\nRights of Probationers: A probationary employee is not entitled to appeal a termination in the same way a permanent employee might, since by law their appointment was not confirmed.\n\nThe probation period is thus a critical time for both employee and employer.

Maintaining regular attendance and punctuality is crucial for the smooth functioning of the organization and for delivering timely services to the public. The general working hours will be as notified by the Govt. of Punjab. However, Director General may extend working hours or direct the staff to attend the office on weekend on grounds of urgency. The guidelines for office hours and attendance are as follows:\n\nAttendance Recording: PERA may use an electronic attendance system (e.g., biometric scanners or an attendance software) to record when employees clock in and out each day. All employees must mark their attendance daily, both at the time of arrival and departure. If an employee is assigned off-site duties or is on approved travel, they should notify their supervisor and HR so that attendance can be recorded appropriately.\n\nPunctuality: Employees are expected to be present at their workstations and ready to work by the official start time. Habitual lateness is not acceptable. Persistent tardiness or leaving early without authorization will be noted and could lead to deductions in leave or pay, and disciplinary action if it continues despite warnings.\n\nAbsence and Leave Approval: Any planned absence from work during scheduled hours must be covered by an appropriate leave approval (see Chapter IV on Leave). If an employee is unexpectedly unable to attend (e.g., sudden illness or emergency), they must notify their supervisor or the HR office within the same working day, preferably at the start of the day by phone or email. Unauthorized absence (not informing or not having leave sanctioned) is treated seriously as it disrupts work and indicates negligence.\n\nAttendance Monitoring: The Admin Wing will monitor attendance records on a periodic basis (weekly or monthly) to identify issues like chronic lateness or absenteeism. In case of unsatisfactory attendance, HR will issue a verbal or written counselling to the employee and may copy the relevant Director. Continued attendance issues after warnings can lead to formal disciplinary action.\n\nBy adhering to prescribed work hours and attendance rules, employees contribute to a disciplined and efficient work culture.

The categories of employees and their salary determination are as follows:\n\nRegular Employees (Permanent Staff): PERA’s regular employees are typically governed by the Basic Pay Scales (BPS) system. These employees will be entitled to such PERA Special Pay Package as per service regulations.\n\nDeputationists: Deputationists who join PERA will draw the salary and allowances as admissible to them as per Deputation Policy of Govt. of Punjab.\n\nContractual Employees: Contract employees hired under the Special PERA Pay Package (SPPP) may not be on BPS but on lump-sum contract salaries. These salaries could be structured as all-inclusive (no separate allowances, just one consolidated amount) or with certain breakout (like a base pay plus social security benefits etc.), as stated in the contract. Such employees are not eligible for the standard government allowances that regular BPS employees get. However, PERA ensures that contract pay packages are competitive and commensurate with the qualifications and expertise required.\n\nPay Days and Mode: Salaries are paid on a monthly basis, typically by the last working day of each month. If that day falls on a weekend or holiday, salaries may be disbursed on the preceding working day.

The categories of employees and their salary determination are as follows:\n\nRegular Employees (Permanent Staff): PERA’s regular employees are typically governed by the Basic Pay Scales (BPS) system. These employees will be entitled to such PERA Special Pay Package as per service regulations.\n\nDeputationists: Deputationists who join PERA will draw the salary and allowances as admissible to them as per Deputation Policy of Govt. of Punjab.\n\nContractual Employees: Contract employees hired under the Special PERA Pay Package (SPPP) may not be on BPS but on lump-sum contract salaries. These salaries could be structured as all-inclusive (no separate allowances, just one consolidated amount) or with certain breakout (like a base pay plus social security benefits etc.), as stated in the contract. Such employees are not eligible for the standard government allowances that regular BPS employees get. However, PERA ensures that contract pay packages are competitive and commensurate with the qualifications and expertise required.\n\nPay Days and Mode: Salaries are paid on a monthly basis, typically by the last working day of each month. If that day falls on a weekend or holiday, salaries may be disbursed on the preceding working day. Payment is made via direct bank transfer to the employee’s designated bank account (as per the salary account details provided on joining).\n\nSalary during Probation Period: Note that employees on probation receive the same salary as confirmed ones in that grade; probation does not imply a lower salary (only difference is lack of job security initially).\n\nSalary during Training: Employees of the Authority during induction training will not be entitled to Special PERA Allowance.\n\nIn conclusion, PERA strives to maintain equitable pay practices.

These exclusions are necessary to prevent abuse and control costs for non-essential or non-medical expenditures. Below is a general list of exclusions applicable to both OPD and IPD claims under this policy:\n\nCosmetic & Aesthetic Treatments: Any treatment or surgery that is cosmetic in nature and not medically required is not covered. This includes plastic surgery, cosmetic dermatology (e.g. skin laser treatments for beauty marks, Botox injections for wrinkles), hair restoration procedures (hair loss treatment or transplants), and other aesthetic interventions.\n\nWeight Management & Wellness: Treatments and programs primarily for weight reduction (obesity treatment, diet programs) or general wellness that are not addressing a diagnosed illness are excluded. Gym memberships, personal training, or any weight management medications/surgeries done for lifestyle reasons are not reimbursable.\n\nFertility and Contraception: Expenses related to fertility treatments (such as IVF, IUI, ovulation induction) and contraceptive measures are not covered. This includes consultation, testing, or procedures for assisted reproduction. Likewise, routine birth control pills, devices, or elective surgical contraception (e.g. elective tubal ligation/vasectomy) are excluded from medical benefits. However, complications arising from a procedure or medically necessary treatment of reproductive health issues would be covered if not purely for fertility enhancement.\n\nRoutine Optical and Dental Care: Optical aids such as prescription eyeglasses, contact lenses, and routine eye exams for corrective lenses are not reimbursable. Vision correction procedures like LASIK surgery are also excluded when done for refractive error/cosmetic reasons. Similarly, dental expenses for routine care and elective procedures are excluded – for example, cleaning, fillings (except if due to acute tooth decay causing illness), cosmetic dental work (teeth whitening, bonding, orthodontic braces, dentures, dental implants) are not covered. Exception: Dental treatment that is necessitated by an acute injury or accident (e.g., fixing teeth damaged in an accident) or for relief of severe pain/infection may be considered. For instance, an emergency tooth extraction or jaw surgery after an accident can be claimed if properly documented as medically necessary.\n\nOver-the-Counter (OTC) Items and Supplements: Medicines or items that do not require a prescription (OTC drugs) and general health supplements will not be covered, unless part of a prescribed treatment for a diagnosed condition. This includes items like vitamins, multivitamins, protein supplements, herbal remedies, nutritional shakes, baby formulas and milks, etc., even if recommended by a doctor as part of general wellness. Cosmetic products (medicated shampoos, creams, moisturizers, sunscreen, etc. used for general skincare) are not covered. Dietary supplements and tonics that are not treating a specific illness are excluded. Only medicines prescribed by a doctor for a specific illness or deficiency are admissible (e.g., iron supplements for diagnosed anemia would be covered if prescribed).\n\nDurable Medical Equipment & Miscellaneous Appliances: Purchase or rental of durable medical equipment for home use is not covered. This includes items like home-use nebulizers, glucometers, blood pressure monitors, wheelchairs, crutches, hearing aids, prosthetic limbs, orthopedic supports, thermometers, weight scales, air purifiers etc. Standard medical aids given as part of hospital treatment (e.g., a surgical implant, or crutches given immediately post-surgery) are covered as part of that hospitalization bill, but personal-use items for convenience or long-term use are excluded.\n\nPreventive Care & Vaccinations: Preventive healthcare measures such as routine physical check-ups, screening tests done without a doctor’s recommendation (e.g., an executive health check package taken on one’s own initiative), immunizations/vaccinations for general prevention, and travel vaccines are not covered (Exception: If vaccination is part of post-exposure treatment, e.g., rabies shots after an animal bite, it will be covered as treatment of that incident).", "text_sha256": "d4da33d0da87cb6116c0cbdb45a42c1d551c8e576abaf3c0e0a63080a1a03fc3", "embed_text_version": 2, "embed_text_sha256": "35305a98645762a758de3d932899660d2e80b0c269f1764fa141ae0eb1a2d3ed", "search_text_version": 1, "search_text_sha256": "d61172205cbfcb5f5ab97da959e948a6fc64f4cfe26daf22ce5123ffd7bc7aa1", "search_text": "DOC: Flag-I; HR Manual.docx\nTYPE: docx\nLOC: Section: \"7.5 Exclusions and Limitations\" (Paragraphs 245–257)\nTAGS:\n\n7.5 Exclusions and Limitations\n\nWhile the PERA Medical Policy aims to cover a broad range of legitimate medical expenses, certain treatments, services, or items are excluded from medical benefits.

PERA has a Public Complaint Intake Form for this purpose. You would need to provide details like the location and nature of the issue, a description of the incident, and any evidence (photos/videos) if available. The complaint can be submitted to the nearest PERA Enforcement Station or through the online channels provided by PERA.

The PERA Act explicitly encourages whistleblower disclosures. A “Whistle-blower” is defined in the law as any person who, in public interest, discloses a suspected violation or offence under the Act. This means anyone (including a citizen or a PERA employee) can confidentially report a violation of the law to PERA. The Act provides a formal mechanism for such whistle-blower disclosures – they can be made in writing or electronic form to the Authority, a Board, a Hearing Officer or an enforcement officer. PERA values these disclosures as a way to uncover violations that might otherwise go unnoticed. In fact, if a whistleblower’s information leads to a successful enforcement action, PERA may reward the whistleblower with a monetary reward from its fund and a certificate of appreciation.\n\nWill my identity be protected if I report an issue as a whistleblower?\n\nAbsolutely. Protecting the whistleblower’s identity is a core principle in PERA’s law. The Act explicitly states that the identity of a whistleblower shall not be disclosed without their consent. This confidentiality applies even after the case is concluded. Any unauthorized disclosure of a whistleblower’s identity is an offence as it can result in a fine or penalty for the person who breaches that confidentiality. Furthermore, PERA (or the Hearing Officer on its behalf) can take special measures to protect whistleblowers who might be at risk due to their disclosure. This could include ensuring anonymity in proceedings or providing other protections as needed. In summary, if you come forward with information as a whistleblower, PERA will guard your identity and you will be shielded by law against retaliation or exposure.\n\nAre whistleblowers rewarded or penalized for their disclosures?\n\nPERA’s policy is to reward genuine whistleblowers and discourage false reports. If your whistleblower disclosure leads to uncovering a real violation or prevents a harm, PERA may grant you a reward (such as a cash reward from a designated fund) and even a certificate of appreciation. This is to recognize public-spirited individuals who help PERA enforce the law. On the other hand, if someone deliberately makes a false, frivolous or vexatious report under the guise of whistleblowing, the law provides for punishment: such a person, after due inquiry, can face up to one year imprisonment or a fine up to Rs. 100,000 (or both).

The PERA Code of Conduct (outlined in the HR Manual and regulations) requires employees to perform their duties honestly and efficiently, avoid any form of corruption or abuse of power, and maintain discipline. They must treat the public fairly and avoid conflicts of interest.\n\nWhat can lead to disciplinary action against a PERA employee?\n\nSeveral grounds can lead to a PERA employee being proceeded against disciplinarily (as per the PERA Efficiency & Discipline Regulations, 2025). The main triggers include: inefficiency (if an employee is found unable or unwilling to perform their duties effectively); misconduct (any improper behavior or violation of service discipline); corruption (for example, if the employee is living beyond known means or has unexplained wealth, or any act of accepting bribes, etc., similar to definitions under the Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability Act); and subversive activities or security breaches (if an employee is engaged in activities prejudicial to national security or discloses official secrets unlawfully).\n\nWhat are the penalties for misconduct by a PERA employee?\n\nPERA’s Efficiency & Discipline Regulations list a range of penalties that can be imposed on employees found guilty of misconduct or other offences, categorized as minor and major penalties. Minor penalties include: a censure (official reprimand); confinement to quarters for ranks like Sergeants (up to 15 days); withholding of increments (salary raises) for a specified period (up to 5 years); a fine (up to one month’s basic pay); reduction to a lower stage in the pay scale (demotion by a few pay steps, up to 5 stages); and withholding of promotion for a period (up to 5 years). These minor penalties are for less severe infractions. Major penalties are more severe and include: recovery of losses (deducting from the employee’s pay or pension the amount of any loss caused by their misconduct); reduction to a lower post/grade for up to 5 years (temporary demotion in rank); forfeiture of service (not counting a certain period of service toward benefits, up to 5 years); compulsory retirement from service; removal from service (which is termination but not disqualification for future employment); and dismissal from service (the strictest penalty, which usually disqualifies the person from future government employment).\n\nHow are disciplinary proceedings conducted for employees?\n\nDisciplinary proceedings in PERA follow a formal, step-by-step process to ensure fairness (much like general government servants’ rules). When an allegation arises, the competent authority (a senior official designated to deal with discipline) may first do a fact-finding or issue a show-cause notice. If a formal inquiry is needed, the employee (now “accused”) is given a charge sheet – a written statement of the charges and allegations, along with any evidence – and asked to submit a written defense within a specified time (usually 7 days). An Inquiry Officer or Inquiry Committee is appointed (they must be senior in rank to the accused) to conduct the inquiry. The inquiry functions almost like a mini-trial: the Inquiry Officer/Committee reviews documents, hears witnesses, and allows the accused employee to present a defense. The inquiry is done day-to-day to avoid delay, and undue adjournments are not allowedDuring this process, if the employee tries to obstruct the inquiry, the inquiry can proceed ex parte (without them) after a warning. At the end, the Inquiry Officer/Committee writes an inquiry report with findings on whether each charge is proven or not. This report goes to the competent authority, who then makes a decision. If the charges are proven, the competent authority decides on an appropriate penalty from the list of penalties and issues an order in writing. Throughout this, the employee has the right to a defense and to be heard in person if they request. The goal of the procedure is to ensure that no one is punished without evidence and an opportunity to explain their side, as per PERA’s regulations and general principles of due process.\n\nCan a PERA employee appeal a disciplinary decision?", "text_sha256": "d73838aec436aee642bb960008db53d00645f4acc7e1078164a1c9a15d9d4c76", "embed_text_version": 2, "embed_text_sha256": "080a23d704f7547dec7f5320f5f36cdcc190013c84573e32ad3e312607d247c3", "search_text_version": 1, "search_text_sha256": "7e3eb5da34584e9c92cf61e4fbb66a453a57d14db8874d1cd550c06997e5f813", "search_text": "DOC: PERA – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).docx\nTYPE: docx\nLOC: Section: \"Employee Conduct, Discipline, and Penalties\" (Paragraphs 27–32)\nTAGS:\n\nEmployee Conduct, Discipline, and Penalties\n\nWhat conduct is expected of PERA employees?\n\nPERA employees are expected to uphold the highest standards of integrity, professionalism, and compliance with the law.

PERA employees have the right to appeal against disciplinary penalties. The Efficiency & Discipline Regulations designate an Appellate Authority for each type of employee (often a higher official or committee, as listed in Schedule-I of the regulations). If an employee is aggrieved by the punishment ordered by the competent authority, they can file a departmental appeal to the Appellate Authority. The appeal must usually be submitted within a certain time frame (commonly 30 days from the order). The Appellate Authority will review the case, which may include re-examining the evidence or considering any new facts, and then pass an order – either upholding the original decision, modifying the penalty, or overturning it. Beyond the departmental appeal, PERA’s regulations also allow a revision in certain cases[69], which is another review (often by the highest authority or the Authority Board) if there is some glaring issue or illegality in the orders of the lower authorities. It’s worth noting that during appeal, the implementation of the penalty may be paused or it may continue – depending on the rules and the discretion of the appellate authority. Also, even after exhausting internal appeals, an employee could seek judicial remedy (e.g., in Punjab Service Tribunal) as per general service laws.

PERA employees have the right to appeal against disciplinary penalties. The Efficiency & Discipline Regulations designate an Appellate Authority for each type of employee (often a higher official or committee, as listed in Schedule-I of the regulations). If an employee is aggrieved by the punishment ordered by the competent authority, they can file a departmental appeal to the Appellate Authority.

When there are vacancies, these are typically advertised publicly (in newspapers or online) to invite applications. Candidates go through a selection procedure that can include written tests, interviews, and background checks. The selection is designed to be fair and transparent. A Selection Panel/Committee assesses the candidates against the required qualifications and competencies for the role. PERA places emphasis on hiring people with relevant skills and a good track record, often preferring candidates with understanding of the “Scheduled laws” and needed technical abilities (for enforcement roles, physical fitness and integrity are important as well). Once selected, a candidate receives an appointment letter from the competent authority (Director General or another authorized officer) specifying the terms of employment. All regular appointments are made under Section 11 of the Act (with government approval where required) and according to the PERA (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Regulations, 2025.\n\nWhat is the difference between regular and contractual employees at PERA?\n\nPERA has both regular (permanent) employees and contractual employees. Regular employees are those appointed against permanent posts – they usually join on probation (typically for one year) and upon confirmation become permanent staff with ongoing tenure. Contractual employees, on the other hand, are hired for specific periods (e.g.3-year contract). PERA has issued separate regulations to govern the terms of contractual staff – the PERA (Appointment and Conditions of Service for Contractual Employees) Regulations, 2025. The fundamental difference is in terms of job security and benefits: Regular employees enjoy pension or retirement benefits and have a career path in the organization, whereas contractual employees are not pensionable and their contract can simply expire at the end of term (or be renewed). Contractual staff may also have different leave entitlements and slightly different disciplinary procedures (often a simpler process for termination if needed, compared to permanent employees). However, in day-to-day roles, contractual employees work alongside regular employees and are expected to follow the same operational rules and code of conduct. PERA often uses contractual appointments for certain technical roles or to staff new units quickly. That said, all PERA employees, whether regular or contract, are considered “employees of the Authority” and are bound by PERA’s Act and rules. They are also all deemed public servants under the law[75], meaning they must uphold similar standards of integrity.\n\nIs there a probation period for new PERA employees?\n\nYes, all newly appointed PERA employees go through a probation period. For regular (permanent) appointments, the probation is typically one year from the date of joining (as per standard government practice, it may be extendable once if needed). For contractual employees, the probation period is usually shorter – commonly three months (and in some cases up to six months) depending on the contract terms. The purpose of probation is to allow PERA to evaluate a new hire’s performance, conduct, and suitability for the role, and likewise for the employee to understand the job expectations. During probation, the employee’s immediate supervisor closely monitors their work and provides feedback. If the employee’s performance is satisfactory by the end of probation, their appointment is confirmed (in case of regular staff). If performance is weak but shows potential, the probation can be extended once to give additional time for improvement. However, if the employee is found unsuitable or has serious issues, PERA can terminate the employment during or at the end of probation without the full process required for confirmed employees\n\nWhat is an Enforcement Station?", "text_sha256": "28e783eab26ee1204e64d401497fe0eb5db7d186653967100a549a7fe9300258", "embed_text_version": 2, "embed_text_sha256": "351f1c06fca26d9e997c203cbc2d02f977d3b130afb65bf57dc5176761ad3a99", "search_text_version": 1, "search_text_sha256": "71c446468afb864181c9c48b5be5935082c806c71a38c9648f15ed655ff90e15", "search_text": "DOC: PERA – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).docx\nTYPE: docx\nLOC: Section: \"Recruitment and Conditions of Service\" (Paragraphs 33–39)\nTAGS:\n\nRecruitment and Conditions of Service\n\nHow does PERA recruit its employees?\n\nPERA follows a merit-based recruitment process for hiring.

It is a defined jurisdiction (often corresponding to a sub-division or district) where PERA’s enforcement team operates. In practical terms, it functions somewhat like a police station but for PERA enforcement officers – it’s the base from which Enforcement Officers, SDEOs, Sergeants and other staff carry out operations in that area. Complaints are often lodged at the Enforcement Station; enforcement teams deploy from there to conduct inspections, raids, and other activities. Each Enforcement Station is headed by a Sub-Divisional Enforcement Officer (SDEO), who supervises the Enforcement Officers and sergeants in that station’s jurisdiction. The station maintains registers of inspections, seizures, etc., and coordinates with the District Enforcement and Regulatory Board (DERB) for that district. For the public, the Enforcement Station is the most accessible face of PERA. It’s where you might go to submit a complaint or respond to a notice. PERA plans to have multiple Enforcement Stations across Punjab, so that enforcement of scheduled laws is decentralized and efficient. Each station’s jurisdiction is officially approved by the Government and notified, ensuring there’s no overlap or confusion about which station covers which area.\n\nFines and Penalties\n\nQ: Will I get a chance to comply before being fined or punished?\n\nA: Yes. In most cases, PERA gives you an opportunity to comply voluntarily before imposing a fine or stronger action. Typically, an official notice or order will be served instructing you to fix the violation (for example, remove an encroachment or stop a public nuisance) within a specified time. For urgent issues that pose immediate harm, an officer may issue an Emergency Prohibition Order (EPO) on the spot, but even then you are given a short timeframe to obey or appeal the order. If you address the problem within the given time, or if you successfully challenge the notice through a Hearing Officer, you can avoid fines or further punishment.

After the initial deadline passes without compliance, PERA officers are empowered to take direct action. They can forcibly remove or remedy the violation (e.g. clear an encroachment or abate a nuisance) using reasonable force, and you’ll be liable for any resulting enforcement costs. They can also impose additional fines as provided under the Act and even confiscate equipment or seal premises associated with the offence. If you continue to defy orders (for example, not paying fines or obstructing officers), PERA may register a case (FIR) with the police for further legal action.\n\nOffences and Violations under PERA\n\nQ: What types of violations are punishable under PERA?\n\nA: PERA covers a range of public offences. Key examples include:\n\nPublic Nuisance: Any illegal act or omission that causes common injury, danger or annoyance to the public is considered a public nuisance. This can include activities causing environmental hazards, health risks, excessive noise, or blocking public ways. Such nuisances are punishable under PERA – Enforcement Officers can issue orders to stop the nuisance and have it removed.\n\nEncroachment on Public Property: Making an encroachment (moveable or immoveable) on state/public land is strictly prohibited by law. This means you cannot unlawfully occupy or build on government property (for example, setting up an illegal structure on a road or park). PERA authorities can order the removal of encroachments; if you don’t comply in time, they will remove it and recover costs and fines from the encroacher.\n\nViolating Official Orders (EPO/Absolute Order): If PERA issues an Emergency Prohibition Order or a subsequent Absolute Order (after a hearing) and you refuse to comply, that refusal itself is a punishable offence. Non-compliance with these orders can result in PERA taking action to enforce the order (as described above) and imposing fines. Repeated or willful defiance can even lead to your arrest or an FIR for disobeying the law.\n\nObstructing Enforcement Officers: It is illegal to hinder or obstruct a PERA officer from performing their duties. If someone tries to interfere with an enforcement operation or attacks/threatens an officer, it is treated very seriously. Creating any obstruction for an Enforcement Officer can trigger immediate actions like arrest on the spot. Such conduct may also be prosecuted under relevant laws (since obstructing public servants is an offence). In summary, you must not resist or impede PERA officials – cooperation is in your best interest.\n\nOther Offences: PERA also penalizes certain other acts, such as false complaints/whistle-blower misuse (knowingly giving false information or false whistle-blower reports) and misuse of authority by PERA employees, with fines specified for these in the law. While these may not directly concern most of the general public, they ensure accountability on all sides (for example, a person making a frivolous complaint to harass someone can be fined up to Rs. 100,000).\n\nEnforcement Process (Notices, Hearings)\n\nQ: What is an “Absolute Order” under PERA?\n\nA: An Absolute Order is essentially the follow-up, final order issued by a Hearing Officer after reviewing an EPO. If a person appeals an EPO, the Hearing Officer conducts a hearing and then can convert the temporary EPO into a more formal Absolute Order (or cancel/modify it). The Absolute Order will detail the nuisance or violation, confirm what must be done to fix it, set a final deadline, and mention any further penalty for not complying. Once an Absolute Order is issued, you are expected to comply within the given timeframe. If you fail to do so, PERA will execute the order: officers will carry out necessary actions (removal, seizure, etc.), and you’ll face fines or other penalties as specified. Essentially, the Absolute Order is the final binding directive after due process (your hearing), and ignoring it has serious consequences.\n\nQ: Do I have a right to be heard or contest a PERA action?", "text_sha256": "e48a00a769e868b11a95ae28c9e17625fb91afaf7d6e8cd01d0bca6ed3024cde", "embed_text_version": 2, "embed_text_sha256": "a81394d9c9a6b1dcfbb69e012b47199f22a107b998a6e5af42205ffb3280f24a", "search_text_version": 1, "search_text_sha256": "037d02512fb92c5454e742236e7c3d9644869d4dfca91cbc2250b629fa8ea249", "search_text": "DOC: PERA – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).docx\nTYPE: docx\nLOC: Section: \"Recruitment and Conditions of Service\" (Paragraphs 40–54)\nTAGS:\n\nQ: What happens if I ignore a PERA notice or refuse to pay a fine?\n\nA: Ignoring PERA’s notices or orders will escalate the enforcement process.

Essentially, the Absolute Order is the final binding directive after due process (your hearing), and ignoring it has serious consequences.\n\nQ: Do I have a right to be heard or contest a PERA action?\n\nA: Yes. PERA’s enforcement system includes provisions for due process. If you’re on the receiving end of an enforcement action (like an EPO or a notice of violation), you generally have the right to file a representation before a Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer is an independent official who will hear your side of the story. During the hearing, you can present evidence or explain your position. The Hearing Officer can then decide to uphold, cancel, or modify the enforcement order (and issue an Absolute Order accordingly). Furthermore, if you disagree with the Hearing Officer’s decision, the law allows you to appeal to higher authorities (first to the divisional Commissioner, and even to a court in second appeal) for redress.

Will there be a criminal case (FIR)?\n\nA: Yes, serious violations can lead to arrest and criminal prosecution, though this usually happens in more extreme cases or repeat offenses. The PERA Act explicitly states that all offences under the Act are cognizable and non-bailable, meaning the police can arrest offenders without a warrant and bail is not a right. PERA’s Sub-Divisional Enforcement Officer (SDEO) is empowered to register an FIR (First Information Report) with the police for offences under the Act. In practice, PERA will involve the police if: you continue to defy orders or repeat a violation, if you assault or obstruct an officer, or in any situation where a simple fine or removal action isn’t sufficient to stop the offence.\n\nQ: What will happen after FIR?\n\nFor most first-time or minor violations, PERA tries to handle the matter with its own notices, fines, and hearings. But if those measures fail or the offence is of a criminal nature, it escalates to an FIR – at that point, you may be arrested and tried in court (offences under PERA are tried by magistrates). In summary, PERA can and will refer cases to the police when needed. It’s always better to comply with PERA’s directives early on, rather than face an FIR and criminal charges for non-compliance.", "text_sha256": "b602d7648d7b11d1a0038d66fca44ece2e14778564f4bcd9da0ef2304fe5714c", "embed_text_version": 2, "embed_text_sha256": "3ec4acbb82621b920c47eb6908dece91c6aab4de9daeea146d9d3b43852912ce", "search_text_version": 1, "search_text_sha256": "8204d4cf78ba96f9c1b4b7b1230a6f10ee1e90fa45a14a46df665185f5b601fa", "search_text": "DOC: PERA – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).docx\nTYPE: docx\nLOC: Section: \"Recruitment and Conditions of Service\" (Paragraphs 40–54)\nTAGS:\n\nPERA will execute the order: officers will carry out necessary actions (removal, seizure, etc.), and you’ll face fines or other penalties as specified.

In practice, PERA will involve the police if: you continue to defy orders or repeat a violation, if you assault or obstruct an officer, or in any situation where a simple fine or removal action isn’t sufficient to stop the offence.\n\nQ: What will happen after FIR?\n\nFor most first-time or minor violations, PERA tries to handle the matter with its own notices, fines, and hearings. But if those measures fail or the offence is of a criminal nature, it escalates to an FIR – at that point, you may be arrested and tried in court (offences under PERA are tried by magistrates). In summary, PERA can and will refer cases to the police when needed. It’s always better to comply with PERA’s directives early on, rather than face an FIR and criminal charges for non-compliance."}

Some specific scenarios include:\n\nObstruction or Violence: If someone attacks, threatens, or seriously obstructs a PERA enforcement team, an FIR will likely be lodged immediately for obstructing official duties. This ensures the offender can be arrested and the behavior is dealt with under criminal law.\n\nRepeat or Egregious Violations: If an individual or business keeps flouting the law – for example, repeatedly setting up an illegal encroachment after removal, or continuously creating public nuisances, in all such cases, PERA may decide to involve the police. Repeated non-compliance shows intent, and a criminal case can be registered to deter further violations.\n\nFailure to Comply with Orders: When someone outright refuses to comply with an Absolute Order or an EPO (and especially after being given opportunities through notices and hearings), the SDEO can file an FIR to enforce the law. Essentially, if you ignore PERA’s administrative penalties, they will switch to criminal enforcement.\n\nOther Offences under the Act: Certain violations (like those involving fraud, impersonation, or other criminal behavior) might be handed to police directly. Also, if PERA uncovers a violation of a law outside its immediate scope while enforcing (say, a criminal act under another law), it can coordinate with police to address that.\n\nIn all these cases, PERA works with the police to ensure the offence is prosecuted. Once an FIR is registered, the matter goes into the criminal justice system where the police investigate and the courts adjudicate the offence. Remember, the vast majority of compliance issues won’t reach this stage if you cooperate; FIRs are a last resort for serious breaches of the law.\n\nQ: What are the consequences if a case is referred to the police?\n\nA: If your violation gets referred to the police via an FIR, it means the issue has escalated beyond administrative fines. Consequences include: possible arrest, as offences under PERA are cognizable (you can be arrested without warrant). You will have to deal with a criminal case, the police will investigate, and you might have to appear in court. If found guilty by the court, you could face criminal penalties which might include imprisonment or additional fines, depending on the offence (for example, obstructing public servants or other penal code violations carry jail terms). Moreover, having an FIR/court case is itself a hassle – it consumes time and resources, and being non-bailable under the Act means you might not get immediate bail. In short, once a case goes to police, the matter becomes much more serious: your freedom could be at stake aside from just monetary penalties. This is why PERA involvement with police is typically reserved for those who refuse to comply with the easier, civil enforcement steps. Compliance with PERA’s notices and orders early on can prevent such outcomes and keep the matter out of criminal courts.\n\nQ: How can I report a violation or nuisance to PERA?\n\nA: If you’re a member of the public wanting to report an issue (like an illegal encroachment in your area or a public nuisance affecting your community), you can file a complaint to PERA. The law allows any aggrieved person or even a concerned bystander to report a public nuisance or encroachment to the Enforcement Officer or relevant PERA office. You may contact your local Enforcement Station (PERA office at the sub-division level) or use any official complaint channels PERA provides (such as a hotline or online portal, if available). When you report, give as many details as possible (location, nature of the problem, people involved, etc.). PERA will then investigate, whereby, PERA official will likely inspect the site, and if the issue falls under PERA’s mandate, they will take action (issuing notices or orders to the offender as described earlier). Reporting is encouraged because it helps the authority identify and address violations that affect the public. There are also whistle-blower protections in the Act – if you report in good faith, your identity can be kept confidential to protect you. Just ensure that the complaint is genuine; knowingly filing a false complaint is itself punishable.\n\nQ: What are the consequences for a PERA officer if they misuse their authority?", "text_sha256": "e21f8f57e2d8cdb9efdf74ddcf84f4a15774cdc24f891608bebfb666c6d87090", "embed_text_version": 2, "embed_text_sha256": "e530cb795b4464ee4ade945b222ec7c9c5ff02491505b5e27d979a689190a23d", "search_text_version": 1, "search_text_sha256": "fd86e4cd9ef2fa2f834a4761102c641595a67182048014476a8124635cd8b93e", "search_text": "DOC: PERA – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).docx\nTYPE: docx\nLOC: Section: \"Recruitment and Conditions of Service\" (Paragraphs 55–63)\nTAGS: members\n\nQ: Under what circumstances will PERA register a case with the police?\n\nA: PERA refers cases to the police primarily in instances of serious, wilful, or continuing violations.
